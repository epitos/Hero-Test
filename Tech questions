Q. How long did you spend on the coding test? 

A.Possibly 2 and 1/2 or 3 hours. 

Q.What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 

A. I would have finished my sorting function, which was going to sort the list in ascending order by Brand name. 
I was planning to do this via a check box. I would have also added several other sorting mechanics, such sorting by 
desending order.

Q.How would you track down a performance issue in production? Give an example of when youâ€™ve done this previously.  

A. Previously, how I've tracked down a performance issue, was by using a tool called Crashlytics. On a previous project I worked on
called Easyfundrasing, I used this tool, to keep track of issues that occured with the app in realtime by receiving email 
notifications The information gathered from the issues were the version of the OS and device the app haD an issue on.
With this tool, I was alble to find the line(s) of code where the issue lied so that I could fix it.
